# My TypeScript Journey

I'm reading a book called **TypeScript in 50 Lessons** by Stefan Baumgartner. It's a great resource for learning TypeScript step by step.

I wanted to practice the code examples from the book, but I couldn't find a public repo that has them. The author has shared the starter code, but not the solutions.

So I decided to create my own repo and follow along the book. In this repo, you'll find a folder for each lesson and the code I wrote. I'll update the repo as I progress through the book.

Here is my current status:

- [x] Chapter 1: TypeScript for Smashing People
- [ ] Chapter 2: Working with Types
- [ ] Chapter 3: Functions
- [ ] Chapter 4: Generics
- [ ] Chapter 5: Advanced Types
- [ ] Chapter 6: TypeScript and React
- [ ] Chapter 7: TypeScript and Node.js
